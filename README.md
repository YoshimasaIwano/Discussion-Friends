# Discussion-Friends

## Explanation
This is a hackathon project for treasure hack contributed by @YoshimasaIwano, @Kaiyu0128 and @FuyaKoshiro

## Inspirations
The development of Chat GPT has brought AI hallucination to the forefront as a major issue to be addressed. In a tongue-in-cheek response, we created a web service that aims to improve users' critical thinking skills by leveraging the Chat GPT API.

## What It Does
Our platform allows users to engage in arguments with a language model-based AI by typing in a topic they wish to discuss. The AI provides counterarguments, and after the conversation, users receive a summary of the exchange. For future reference, users can review the logs of their interactions with the AI.

## How We Built It
We developed the front-end using **React** and _(insert additional front-end technologies here)_. For the back-end, we utilized **Python**, **Flask**, the **Chat GPT-API**, and the **Whisper-API**.
